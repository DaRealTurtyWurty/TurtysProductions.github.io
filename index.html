                <h6>
                    Hello everyone, my name is TurtyWurty(that is not my actual name, but that is what you shall 
                    know me as). I am a programmer and currently make mods for a game which goes by the name 
                    of Minecraft. This is just a hobby of mine and when I am older I want to develop software, etc. 
                    But for now lets talk about Minecraft Modding, firstly it is all done in Java(or Kotlin) and uses 
                    an API named 'Minecraft Forge'. Forge is a very big API and is quite heavyweight. There are other 
                    alternative APIs to use such as Rift and Fabric which are much more lightweight, but personally, 
                    I use forge.

                <p class="headingPara">Why I mod Minecraft?</p>
                <h6>
                        I mod Minecraft just as a hobby, Minecraft is a game that I love to play and is a game with one 
                        of the biggest and best modding communities out there. However I modify it because I have many 
                        ideas that I would love to see in the game whether they are my ideas, or ideas that other 
                        people say. I just really love to visualize all the suggestions and ideas that pop into mine 
                        and other's heads. With that in mind, not all my mods are suggestions and things that I would 
                        like to see added on a serious note. I have several mods where I just 'mess' around, add 
                        silly ideas and things which I just think would look really cool. 
                </h6>

                <p class="headingPara">What Mods have I made?</p>
                <h6>
                        I have made several mods and I am consistently working on them. I used to have a mod 
                        named Turty's Food Mod, however due to an error with the API: 'Forge'. There was a 
                        bug that corrupted my mod and loads of other's which made everyone's textures and models 
                        fail to load. Even though this really took me away from modding for a few months, I soon 
                        come back not long after with lots of motivation to work on new ideas and overcome the 
                        massive loss. Now I am not going to lie, it was not an easy thing to do, I put a of work 
                        into my Minecraft Mods, silly or not. I really have a passion in programming them and 
                        seeing it all come to life within the game. My other mods that I have made/are making include:<br><br>

                        <li><u>Minecraft Madness Mod</u> - This mod adds a bunch of cool stuff and is very random, but is mainly for 
                        me to just mess around and have some fun really. The 'backstory' to the mod is that the world 
                        has opened up a gateway to a world very similar but with one twist, everything is mutated and 
                        crazy. I have actually added a lot of things to this mod, but I have slowly drawn away from it 
                        to work on more 'themed' projects.</li><br>

                        <li><u>Vanilla Expansion</u> - This is a mod which intends to totally overhaul the vanilla world by 
                        upgrading all the biomes; this means adding new structures, entities, food and much, much 
                        more to enhance the vanilla experience. When I say 'all the biomes', I mean every single biome, 
                        now this may sound like an impossible project to do by myself, and it probably is, but I figured 
                        I would give it my best shot and see what I can achieve.</li><br>

                        <li><u>Ruby Mod</u> - At first this was just a joke mod which I used to troll some online friends with that 
                        I made on an alternate account. But I actually enjoyed making it quite a lot. However, ruby mods 
                        are often frowned upon due to there being a surplus of them and because of this they are classed 
                        as unoriginal. But mine adds lots that others don't such as furnaces and crafting tables.</li><br>
                        
                        <li><u>Fantasia</u> - Fantasia is a mod that intends to massively increase the duration of the game by 
                        broadening the end-game. It is a fantasy style mod adding a whole new dimension full of mystical 
                        biomes, creatures and plants. The mod does not affect the overworld at all other than adding 1 
                        structure and changing a few loot tables to add a few rare items. This mod is not meant to make 
                        the player get really strong at end-game but instead introduce new challenges, bosses and quests 
                        for the player to achieve.</li><br>

                        <li><u>BeanCraft</u> - BeanCraft is one of my mod's which I consider a lot less serious. As of writing this 
                        I started it literally about 2 days ago. All the mod contains is, you guessed it, beans! This 
                        is due to beans being quite a popular thing in the 'meme community', so I figured it might be 
                        a perfect opportunity to get some 'popularity'. I chose to do this project also because of the 
                        fact that it is a rather simple thing to make, I don't have to really think of ideas, like I 
                        do with my other mods. Now, it is not <i>just</i> beans, it is bean related things and beans. For 
                        example there is a bean dimension with a bean biome, there will be a bean boss, bean blocks, 
                        bean slabs, etc. The list goes on, but because all of these things being reasonably easy to 
                        make(<i>relative</i>), so I thought "Why not?".</li>

                <p class="headingPara">YouTube</p>
                <h6>
                    So yes, you may know of me from YouTube as I have a channel named 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCicAXLV4w2X6bn2EuM4To4w/featured?view_as=subscriber" class="hyperlink">
                        <strong>TurtyWurty</strong></a> 
                    on my channel I post Minecraft Modding Tutorials, these are basically tutorials on how you can 
                    create your own mod. Now you can follow these along quite easily without any programming history or java knowledge, 
                    but if you want to understand it or even create anything that is even slightly different, or fix 
                    errors that you are having, you will need to learn java. Now I am fully aware that this sounds 
                    very intimidating and boring, but learning java really isn't hard. Obviously you are not expected 
                    to learn the whole java language and everything about it! All you really need to learn is the basics, 
                    syntax, and how to use an IDE of your choice. There are 2 main IDEs for java, Eclipse and IntelliJ, 
                    however there are smaller but not recommended ones such as Atom and (debatable)Notepad++.<br><br>

                    Personally, I use Eclipse,  it is almost all up to preference as there is no real things separating 
                    the two, and don't worry, Eclipse does have dark theme, you just have to set it in the Preferences. 
                    But on my channel I do tutorials for the version: 1.12.x. In the future, once I have finished 1.12.x, 
                    I will go on to do tutorials about 1.14.x or whatever the main version is at that time. I do tutorials 
                    from the setup stage of modding all the way up to dimensions, entities and GUI's. As of writing this, 
                    I am still making tutorials and have not moved to the next version yet, but by the time you read this, 
                    I may have moved to 1.14+. The switch will only be when I believe I have done tutorials on every main 
                    aspect of 1.12.2 that I feel needs a tutorial done.
